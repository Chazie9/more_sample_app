    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
    	My name is Charles Harring. I made this site to get a deeper understanding of wed development and product managment. 
      The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
      is a project to teach web development with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
      is the sample application for the tutorial, with some personal mods thrown in :)
